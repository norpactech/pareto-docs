# The Pareto Factory: A Hybrid Approach to Software Development

## Overview

This whitepaper presents **The Pareto Factory**, a metadata-driven development framework that applies the 80/20 principle to software engineering. By automating the repetitive 80% of development tasks while preserving human creativity for the critical 20%, the Pareto Factory enables faster, more consistent, and more maintainable software development.
