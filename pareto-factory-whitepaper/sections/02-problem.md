# 02 – The Problem with Current Software Development Practices

Having spent much of my career developing software as a consultant, I’ve consistently found myself working on projects where a significant portion of the effort is needlessly redundant. Typically, architects like myself will define a functional framework and present it to development teams for implementation.

In Agile environments, developers work from user stories to build application features, write unit tests, and deliver working code. Depending on the project's structure, there may or may not be dedicated roles like a database administrator, a middleware engineer, or a front-end (web/mobile) developer.

Modern frameworks such as **Spring Boot** empower developers to define their own database schemas directly within the application. In many teams, “full-stack” developers are responsible for crafting all tiers of the application—from database to API to UI.

This setup often leads to repeated work. Developers recreate the same foundational components over and over:  
- **Model objects** to represent domain entities (e.g., a person or customer)  
- **Data transfer objects (DTOs)** to move data across application layers  
- **Service interfaces, validation logic, and form bindings**, which all mirror the same structures  

Despite being structurally similar, these components are rewritten again and again across projects. This manual repetition wastes time, introduces inconsistencies, and detracts from the more complex challenges developers are meant to solve.

The core issue is that **we treat every project like a handcrafted product**, even when the requirements are largely predictable or repeated across domains. Teams spend excessive time building foundational components—data access layers, service interfaces, form logic, validation rules—that vary only slightly from one project to the next. This leads to bloated timelines, increased defects, and rising maintenance costs.

While frameworks and libraries abstract some of this work, they still require developers to **re-describe the system repeatedly**, in code, often with the same intent as other layers. These redundancies increase surface area for bugs and reduce overall team velocity.

## The Cost of Inconsistency

Human-written code varies in structure, quality, and conventions. Even with well-documented standards, it’s difficult to enforce uniformity across large or distributed teams. As a result:

- One team’s services don’t look like another’s  
- Field naming conventions drift  
- Error handling becomes ad hoc  
- Debugging and onboarding take longer  

This inconsistency hinders scalability and makes automated tooling less effective. Teams eventually accumulate **technical debt** simply from the act of building things manually, even when they “follow the rules.”

As adimant as I am about organizational structure, I have been taught 

## Tooling Fatigue and Cognitive Overload

Another problem is the growing number of tools, each with its own syntax, configuration model, and build system. A full-stack developer may need to touch:

- SQL (or an ORM)  
- Backend framework (e.g., Spring, Express)  
- REST or GraphQL layer  
- Frontend framework (e.g., Angular, React)  
- CI/CD configuration (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Docker)  

This toolchain complexity results in **context switching**, steeper learning curves, and more time spent configuring tools than delivering value.

## The Documentation Dilemma

Documentation presents another layer of inefficiency in modern development. Teams are expected to maintain comprehensive documentation—API specifications, deployment guides, architectural diagrams, and code comments—yet this documentation is inherently disconnected from the actual implementation.

The fundamental problem is that **documentation exists at the wrong level of abstraction**. Developers spend time writing and updating:

- Code comments that describe what the code already expresses
- API documentation that duplicates what the service interface defines
- Database schema documentation that mirrors the actual table definitions
- Configuration guides that repeat what deployment scripts already encode

This creates a **double maintenance burden**: when code changes, documentation must be manually updated to match. In practice, documentation quickly becomes stale, misleading, or abandoned entirely. Teams either waste time maintaining redundant documentation or accept that their documentation is unreliable.

The real issue is that we're **documenting the implementation rather than the intent**. If the system's design and business rules were captured at a higher level—as structured metadata—then both the code and its documentation could be generated from the same authoritative source. This would eliminate the documentation maintenance problem entirely while ensuring accuracy.

## Missing the Big Picture

Even with modern architectures, teams rarely elevate system design to a higher level of abstraction. Architecture decisions are often embedded in code and tribal knowledge, rather than modeled formally and maintained as a source of truth.

This limits reuse, obscures intent, and makes automation difficult. Without a structured representation of a system’s design, the benefits of automation—repeatability, traceability, and scalability—are left on the table.

---

In short, software development suffers from being:

- **Redundant** – we rewrite code we’ve written before  
- **Inconsistent** – human variability leads to bugs and rework  
- **Overloaded** – the cognitive load from tools and layers is excessive  
- **Under-modeled** – there’s no shared, structured definition of the system itself  

The industry needs a better way to capture intent once and execute it many times. That is the problem the Pareto Factory is designed to solve.
