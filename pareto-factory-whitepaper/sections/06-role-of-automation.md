# 05 â€“ The Role of Automation: Handling the Predictable 80%

*[OUTLINE - Section to be written]*

## Key Points to Cover:

### What Automation Handles
- **Database Layer**: Schema generation, CRUD operations, stored procedures
- **API Layer**: REST endpoints, request/response mapping, validation
- **Service Layer**: Standard business operations, data transformation
- **UI Layer**: Forms, grids, navigation, basic user interactions
- **Infrastructure**: Logging, error handling, security boilerplate

### Code Generation Patterns
- Template-based generation systems
- Plugin architecture for different target technologies
- Version control and merge strategies for generated code
- Handling updates and regeneration

### Quality Assurance Through Automation
- Consistent naming conventions
- Standard error handling patterns
- Built-in security measures
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Automated testing generation

### Benefits of Automated Development
- Elimination of human error in repetitive tasks
- Consistent implementation across teams
- Faster initial development cycles
- Reduced maintenance overhead
- Better adherence to architectural patterns

### Integration with Development Workflow
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Code review processes for generated code
- Deployment automation
- Environment-specific configuration management
